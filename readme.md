# rdx-example

An example app to test and demonstrate "rdx" - like Redux, but smaller

This app creates a **3.1Kb** JS bundle for an SPA including:

Redux-like store (actions + reducers + middleware)
Redux devtool integration
Utils to reduce store boilerplate
Persistence / hydration middleware (localStorage)
Async 'thunk' middleware
Client-side routing with params
UI components bound to state store

See [live demo](https://captaincodeman.github.io/rdx-example/)

NOTE: `rdx` and `rdx-model` is still in development and will be released
when the final pieces (typescript typings) have been completed and the
API tested more.
